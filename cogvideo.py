# The reason for using checkpoints hosted by Camenduru instead of the original is because they exported
# with a max_shard_size of "5GB" when saving the model with `.save_pretrained`. The original converted
# model was saved with "10GB" as the max shard size, which causes the Colab CPU RAM to be insufficient
# leading to OOM (on the CPU)
